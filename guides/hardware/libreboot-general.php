	<p>
	If full disk encryption keeps failing, it's likely because your version of libreboot doesn't support luks2.
	Boot into a live enviroment to change your luks header from version 2 to version 1.

	<h3>T400</h3>
	<p>
	I learned pretty quickly that the 16pin Pomona 5252 or 8pin Pomona 5250 required to flash the thinkpad t400 IS A PAIN to find. The only Pomona 5250 I found online was selling for $200 on ebay which is absurd for a $40 clip. I think it might be better to solder wires directly to the bios chip than rely on finding the clip.
